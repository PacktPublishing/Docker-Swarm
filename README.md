# Docker Swarm [Video]
This is the code repository for [Docker Swarm [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/docker-swarm-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788398251), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Docker Swarm is a cluster manager solution developed by Docker; its best aspect is its simplicity.

In this course, you will learn in detail how Docker Swarm works. Docker Machine is a tool that lets you install Docker Engine on virtual hosts, and manage the hosts with Docker machine commands. You can use Machine to create Docker hosts on your local Mac or Windows box, in your datacenter, or on cloud providers such as AWS or Digital Ocean. Also, you will find out more about Docker images, and how to manage services in the cluster. We'll explore the many components involved in these. We start with the Routing Mesh and explain how it handles traffic to containers. Then we introduce the Overlay network and talk about how we can keep a container in an isolated network. Then we cover Docker Secret, a safe encrypted place to store and inject credentials and secrets into containers. To run tasks in the cluster, you will learn about Docker services and Docker Stack. 

From this course, you'll learn to build clusters and manage Docker Swarm cluster. Also, deploy applications using Docker Stack and manage Docker nodes and systems.
